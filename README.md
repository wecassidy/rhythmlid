# Rhythmlid: a web interface on top of Rhythmbox

This application creates a web-based interface for an instance of
Rhythmbox on the host computer. It allows (nearly) full control of
playback in Rhythmbox from any device on the local network without
having to duplicate the library.

It would be HIGHLY ILL-ADVISED to expose the server to the broader
internet.
